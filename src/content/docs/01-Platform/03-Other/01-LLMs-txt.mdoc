We support the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention for making documentation available to large language models and the applications that make use of them.

Currently we only support the full documentation set.
Our available documentation sets are:

- **[/llms.txt](/llms.txt):** a listing of the available files
- **[/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt):** the full documentation set
