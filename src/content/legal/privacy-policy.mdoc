## 4. The information we collect about you

1. Personal data means any information which does (or could be used to) identify a living person.
    We have grouped together the types of personal data that we collect, and where we receive it from,
    below.

2. Type of personal data:

    - **Identity Data:** your first and last name or title.
    - **Contact Data:** your email address, telephone numbers, home address.
    - **Technical Data:** internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and
        generic location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform on the devices
        you use to access our systems.
    - **Usage Data:** information about how you use our systems.
    - **Location Data:** your device location if you log into our systems remotely.
    - **Feedback:** information and responses you provide when completing surveys and questionnaires.

## 5. How we use your information

1. We are required to identify a legal justification (also known as a lawful basis) for collecting and
    using your personal data. There are six legal justifications which organisations can rely on. The most
    relevant of these to us are where we use your personal data to:

    - comply with a **legal obligation** that we have;
    - pursue our **legitimate interests** (our justifiable business aims) but only if those interests are not
        outweighed by your other rights and freedoms (e.g. your right to privacy).

2. Below is set out the lawful basis we rely on when we use your personal data. If we intend to use
    your personal data for a new reason that is not listed below, we will update our Privacy Notice.

    1. Legal Obligation
        - Recording your preferences (e.g. marketing) to ensure that we comply with data protection laws.
        - Where we send you information to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. where we send you
            information about your legal rights).
        - Where we retain information to enable us to bring or defend legal claims.

    2. Legitimate Interests


    - Where using your information is necessary to pursue our legitimate business interests to:
        - improve and optimise our Website;
        - monitor and make improvements to our Website to enhance security and prevent fraud;
        - provide our services to you and ensure the proper functioning of our Website; and
        - protect our business and defend ourselves against legal claims.

    - Where we use your information for our legitimate interests, we have assessed whether such use is
        necessary and that such use will not infringe on your other rights and freedoms.

3. Where we need to collect your personal data (for example, in order to fulfil a contract we have
    with you), failure to provide us with your personal data may mean that we are not able to provide you
    with the services. Where we do not have the information required about you to fulfil an order, we may
    have to cancel the service ordered.


## 6. Who we share your information with

1. We share (or may share) your personal data with:

- **Our personnel:** our employees (or other types of workers) who have contracts containing
    confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- **Our supply chain:** other organisations that help us provide our goods. We ensure these
    organisations only have access to the information required to provide the support we use them and
    have a contract with them that contains confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- **Regulatory authorities:** such as HM Revenue & Customs.
- **Our professional advisers:** such as our accountants or legal advisors where we require specialist
    advice to help us conduct our business.

2. If we were asked to provide personal data in response to a court order or legal request (e.g. from
    the police), we would seek legal advice before disclosing any information and carefully consider the
    impact on your rights when providing a response.

## 7. Where your information is located or transferred to

1. We store your personal data on our servers in United States of America, UK and EU. We have proper
    mechanisms in place to ensure that transfer to that country is in compliance with relevant data
    protection laws.

2. Except as set out above, we will only transfer information outside of the UK or EEA where we
    have a valid legal mechanism in place (to make sure that your personal data is guaranteed a level of
    protection, regardless of where in the world it is located, e.g. by using contracts approved by the ICO
    or the UK Secretary of State).

3. If you access our Website or purchase our services whilst abroad then your personal data may be
    stored on servers located in the same country as you or your organisation.

## 8. How we keep your information safe

1. We have implemented security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally or
    illegally lost, used or accessed by those who do not have permission. These measures include:

    - access controls and user authentication (including multi-factor authentication);
    - internal IT and network security;
    - regular testing and review of our security measures;
    - staff policies and training;
    - incident and breach reporting processes;
    - business continuity and disaster recovery processes.

2. If there is an incident which has affected your personal data and we are the controller, we will
    notify the regulator and keep you informed (where required under data protection law). Where we act
    as the processor for the affected personal data, we notify the controller and support them with
    investigating and responding to the incident.

3. If you notice any unusual activity on the Website, please contact us support@pandaci.com.


## 9. How long we keep your information

1. Where we act as the controller, we will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
    fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

2. To decide how long to keep personal data (also known as its retention period), we consider the
    volume, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm to you if an incident
    were to happen, whether we require the personal data to achieve the purposes we have identified or
    whether we can achieve those purposes through other means (e.g. by using aggregated data instead),
    and any applicable legal requirements (e.g. minimum accounting records for HM Revenue &
    Customs).

3. We may keep Identity Data, Contact Data and certain other data (specifically, any exchanges
    between us by email or any other means) for up to seven years after the end of our contractual
    relationship with you.

4. If you browse our Website, we keep personal data collected through our analytics tools for only as
    long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

5. If you have asked for information from us or you have subscribed to our mailing list, we keep
    your details until you ask us to stop contacting you.

## 10. Your legal rights

1. You have specific legal rights in relation to your personal data.

2. We can decide not to take any action in relation to a request where we have been unable to
    confirm your identity (this is one of our security processes to make sure we keep information safe) or
    if we feel the request is unfounded or excessive. Usually there is no cost for exercising your data
    protection rights, but we may charge a fee where we decide to proceed with a request that we believe
    is unfounded or excessive. If this happens we will always inform you in writing.

3. We will respond to your legal rights request without undue delay, but within one month of us
    receiving your request or confirming your identity (whichever is later). We may extend this deadline
    by two months if your request is complex or we have received multiple requests at once. If we need to
    extend the deadline, we will let you know and explain why we need the extension.

4. We do not respond directly to requests which relate to personal data for which we act as the
    processor. In this situation, we forward your request to the relevant controller and await their
    instruction before we take any action.

5. If you wish to make any of the right requests listed below, you can reach us at
    support@pandaci.com.

6. Your rights include:

- **Access:** You must be told if your personal data is being used and you can ask for a copy of your
    personal data as well as information about how we are using it to make sure we are abiding by the
    law.
- **Correction:** You can ask us to correct your personal data if it is inaccurate or incomplete. We
    might need to verify the new information before we make any changes.
- **Deletion:** You can ask us to delete or remove your personal data if there is no good reason for us
    to continue holding it or if you have asked us to stop using it (see below). If we think there is a
    good reason to keep the information you have asked us to delete (e.g. to comply with regulatory
    requirements), we will let you know and explain our decision.
    Restriction: You can ask us to restrict how we use your personal data and temporarily limit the
    way we use it.
- **Objection:** You can object to us using your personal data if you want us to stop using it. If we
    think there is a good reason for us to keep using the information, we will let you know and explain
    our decision.
- **Portability:** You can ask us to send you or another organisation an electronic copy of your
    personal data.
- **Complaints:** If you are unhappy with the way we collect and use your personal data, you can
    complain to the ICO or another relevant supervisory body, but we hope that we can respond to
    your concerns before it reaches that stage. Please contact us at support@pandaci.com.

## 11. When we send you marketing messages

1. If you have consented to receiving marketing messages from us, you can opt out of these at any
    time. Just let us know at support@pandaci.com.

2. We market our services to prospective and existing business customers, this is known as
    Business-to-Business Marketing (B2B Marketing). We may send marketing communications to their
    staff via work contact details. If you are a member of staff and do not wish to receive B2B Marketing,
    please let us know at support@pandaci.com.

3. Opting out of marketing will not affect our processing of your personal data in relation to any
    order you have with us and where we are required to use your personal data to fulfil that order or
    provide you with certain information.

## 12. Profiling

1. Personal data will not be used for profiling or other automated decision-making.
