# PandaCI Documentation for LLMs

> PandaCI is a modern continuous integration and deployment platform (CI/CD). PandaCIs workflows are programmed with TypeScript instead of being declared with a syntax like YAML. This allows PandaCIs syntax to be learned in minutes and lets developers use the same language they write their applications to define their CI/CD workflows.
